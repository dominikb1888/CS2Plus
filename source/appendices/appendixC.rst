Appendix C: The str Class
----------------------------

The `Python 3 Documentation
<http://docs.python.org/py3k>`_ site contains this and much more extensive documentation on the Python 3 language, including the `Library Reference 
<http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/index.html>`_ which contains this documentation. This appendix was generated from the Python help system by typing help(str) in the Python interpreter.

Help on class str in module builtins:

class str(object)
 |  str(string[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str
 |  
 |  Create a new string object from the given encoded string.
 |  encoding defaults to the current default string encoding.
 |  errors can be 'strict', 'replace' or 'ignore' and defaults to 'strict'.

 |      have upper case and the rest lower case.
 |  
 |  center(...)

 |  Static methods defined here:
 |  
 |  maketrans(...)
 |      str.maketrans(x[, y[, z]]) -> dict (static method)
 |      
 |      Return a translation table usable for str.translate().
 |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
 |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
 |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
 |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.
